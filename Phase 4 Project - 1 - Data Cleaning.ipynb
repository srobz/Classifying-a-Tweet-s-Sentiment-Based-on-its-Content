    "The spread within products is extremely imbalanced. A majority (over half) of the tweets were not about a determined product. Because of this, I'd like to add another column called \"Brand\" that will simply be what Brand the tweet is about, based on the information from the \"Product\" column. Since these tweets are about Apple or Google products I figure it might be important later on to have this information so I'll make it easier for myself and add the column now. First we'll double-check all of the entries in \"Product\". Then we'll create another function that should loop through the product column and return the brand to our new column. If the brand is undetermined then the function will loop through the text of the tweet and see if any of the product words were used in the tweet, if none of them were used then the brand will be undetermined, if words for both brands are used then the brand will be \"Both\". Hopefully this will help create more balanced classes within this new feature."

    "The spread has significantly changed! Our classes are still imbalanced, but this time in a different way. Over half of the tweets are about the brand Apple, while a third are about the brand Google. Tweets where the brand is undetermined make up about eight percent of all tweets, and tweets about both brands make up around only two percent! While this is better than over half of them being unknown (referring to undetermined product tweets) it is still not good to have these be this imbalanced.\n",

    "Before I move on to preprocessing, I'd like to add a few more columns that will provide me with more information. First I'd like to add a column that contains the character count for the tweets before they are processed. I'd also like to create a column that will contain only the hashtags used within each tweet, as well as a column containing the count of hashtags within each tweet. While I am not using those columns right now I feel they might be useful during the EDA process. I will also add a column called \"Clean\" which will contain the cleaned and processed tweets. That way I still have the original tweets if needed but can easily access the preprocessed tweets as well. For now this column will just be a copy of the \"Tweet\" column."

    "Now I will add a column that will have the cleaned tweet tokens with stopwords removed, I am also going to add a column that will have a count of cleaned tokens. I am also going to tokenize the unclean Tweet column using NLTK's Tweet Tokenizer. I will be grabbing a count of these tokens as well. I'd like to note that it is not necessary to tokenize the uncleaned data, however for the purposes of my analysis I'd like to tokenize it for use further on in my exploration."
